The following are answers to the Step 6 part of Lab 4

  1. I chose the GNU-3.0 because it was a public license and I am not storing anthing propietary. It is also one of the newest of the public licenses
  2. The "Montana State Library recommends that datasets be published in trustworthy data repositories, especially those that are commonly used in your discipline". Specific            repositories include Dryad, Zendodo, and ICPSR. Storage options include box, OneDrive, and Opal
  3. GitHub would help make my data align with FAIR protocols by allowing it to be findable, accessibiltle, interoperable, and reusable.
  4. Some advantages of my data being more accessible is that someone else in my dicsipline has the option of using it to help with their work. It would also help get my name out      in the world.
  5. Some disadvantages of making my data more accessible is that someone could potentially beat me to the punch, finishing work that I am still working on. It could also be            private information. This is actually my biggest hang up of a site like this is that most everything I do as a civil engineer is private at least until completion.
  6. While I don't see any code being on a GitHub from my project it could be useful for people studying the Yellowstone River. I could put up some of my flow split data and fish      bypass flow data. 
  7. I would not publish any of my models or intermediate steps until the project sponsers give their ok. I don't currently know what the agreement is for that so I would find out      before publishing anything specific to the project.
